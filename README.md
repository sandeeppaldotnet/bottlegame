# Battle Game

## Overview

The Battle Game is an interactive game where players use "Attack" or "Defence" actions to increase or decrease their score. The goal is to reach +10 points to win, and if the score reaches -10, the player loses. When the player wins, a fun gift animation is displayed to celebrate the victory.

## Features

- **Attack**: Increases your score randomly between 0 and 10.
- **Defence**: Decreases your score randomly between 0 and 10.
- **Random Play**: A random action is triggered between "Attack" or "Defence".
- **Reset**: Resets the score, last play, and game status.
- **Victory Animation**: Displays a flowing gift animation when the player wins.
